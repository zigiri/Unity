# Leap Motion Unity Modules

To download Leap Motion's latest stable modules as .unitypackages, visit [our Unity developer site][devsite]. Be sure to also check out our [documentation and API reference][um-docs]!

**UnityModules packages from our developer website support Unity 5.6.2, 2017.1-4, and 2018.1.** Newer versions of Unity are usually perfectly safe to use. If you encounter errors or warnings with newer Unity versions, please report them as an Issue.

**The UnityModules *repository* expects Unity 2017.3 and up.** If you are sourcing UnityModules directly from this repository, your mileage may vary with earlier versions of Unity.
